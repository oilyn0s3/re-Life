I'm not saying there's some underlying physical reason why they *should* be distinguished, just that because of the very significant difference in mass it may have been thought they should be different particles.\n\nAnd historically I do believe it *was* this way -- the Wikipedia article for isospin suggests that the four deltas were all considered one particle at one point in time due to their similar mass, and that the different charges were thought of as different states of excitement for that single particle.\n\nThanks to the quark model we now know that it's not correct but that doesn't mean it wasn't viewed that way upon the particles' original discovery.",

This has nothing to do with the precise form of strong interactions, hence nothing to do with hadronic structure. The Breit-Wigner shape is valid in general in (relativistic) quantum mechanics.\n\nAnother meaning is that of excited hadronic structure. The strong force is independent of isospin, therefore excited hadronic states has the same isospin. The nucleon and the delta have different isospin. The delta in not an excited of the nucleon. There is a different excited state of the nucleon with spin 3/2, with a different mass, and the same 1/2 isospin.",
