            "body": "The question is a bit difficult to answer. Maybe I give you some more information so you know what you are asking about. I guess you know that the terms 'negative' and 'positive' are completely arbitrary. We could have also called it 'black' and 'white charge'.\n\nSecondly the question why there are so many (positively charged) protons and (negatively charged) electrons and so few (negatively charged) antiprotons and (positively charged) anti-electrons/positrons in the universe has not yet been fully answered. It's one of the most interesting research topics right now because from our current theories it would (perhaps naively) follow that there should be the same amount of matter and anti-matter.\n\nNow to the question what electric charge really is. Well, it is a fundamental property of the elementary particles of our universe. Here is a [table with all of them](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg) (as far as the Standard Model is concerned). A charge of 1 means 1e. Where e is the charge of a proton. The charm quark for example has a charge of 2/3e. All those particles also have corresponding antiparticles with the opposite charge.\n\nBut charge alone wouldn't do anything without the gauge bosons. In particular the photon. Photons can interact with things that have a charge. The more charge the more it interacts. Electrons interact with photons all the time. [Like so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Electron_self_energy.svg/151px-Electron_self_energy.svg.png) (the electron emits a photon and then reabsorbs it immediately). [Or like this](https://news.slac.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/images/image/renormalized-vertex.jpg) (the electron emits a photon and changes its direction. this happens in antennas: the photons are emitted as electro-magnetic radiation).\n\nNow it seems that electrons and anti-electrons (positrons) interact exactly in the opposite way with photons. You can think of anti-electrons as electrons that are moving backwards in time: where electrons are attracted, anti-electrons are repelled. So it's natural to say that they have opposite charge (or maybe that's not natural but it's what we do). Charge is not really an object in reality. It's just a convenient way to describe the behavior of particles and anti-particles. Opposite charges seem to attract each other but actually they are just exchanging photons and as a result are moving closer to each other.",

So instead of calling them 0, 1, and 2 (or whatever), we just called them \"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\" and named the whole thing \"color charge\".
