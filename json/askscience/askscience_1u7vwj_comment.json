The main issue is that at small length scales, we often rely on self-assembled processes in fabricating nano-structures. These processes often rely of kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of the materials you are using. The field of nanotechnology is very young and anytime you can make novel structures (think of simple geometric shapes), you've made a significant contribution to the field.",

This book answers your question way better than I could in a couple sentences. The short answer is that we are limited by the small scale of a molecule (see QM). You can't really just grab onto and manipulate a single molecule, at least by using any current technology. There are more water molecules in a teaspoon of water than there are teaspoons of water in the Atlantic Ocean. Imagine having to assemble all of those molecules individually into an ice cube. It would be much easier to use some natural process to exploit (crystallization at lower temp) or maybe to have an army of self replicating machines. ",
