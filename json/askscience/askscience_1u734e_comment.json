Sometimes we see animals participating in decidedly novel behaviors, apparently for their own amusement, like [this dolphin creating and playing with bubble rings](http://gifs.gifbin.com/052013/1372784443_dolphin_creates_bubble_rings.gif). Sometimes we see them perform learned acts that mimic human creativity, such as [this elephant that has been taught to paint pictures of elephants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He7Ge7Sogrk). \n\nWe know that some animals develop behaviors that are passed on through observation and are not hard-wired into their instincts. There was at least one case of a [particular method of nut-cracking among chimpanzees that was passed from one chimp to another through observational learning](http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/staff/boesch/pdf/behav_optim_nut-cracking.pdf). The first chimp to come up with that was being creative. \n\nIn terms of self-decoration or monument building or what you might call \"serious human creativity\" not much has been discovered, but animals often engage in mild forms of playful creativity and occasionally invent uses for primitive tools.",

However, you might find [these](http://www.koko.org/world/art_emotional.html) interesting. Gorillas who were taught sign language (Koko and Michael) were asked to produce paintings representing various emotions. Whether what they produced is truly creative or is mindless isn't a question we can really answer, and humans are highly prone to instinctively attribute human characteristics to things that don't posses them as a sort of pattern recognition. But it is interesting to consider- if any other animal is capable of creativity, gorillas (highly intelligent and social creatures) are a good candidate.",
