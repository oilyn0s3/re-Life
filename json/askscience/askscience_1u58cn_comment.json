You'll have countless minor connections to homes and businesses, tied through lateral lines into several trunk sewers which gather the flow, and a handful of interceptor sewers which run to your treatment facilities (or in the case of a completely separate storm sewer, to a local waterway). The interceptor sewers are the largest and straightest, but even those will only stretch a few miles within city limits.\n\nPoint being, it's about the relative elevation of the ends of those pipes. \n\nThe curvature of the earth is so minor that even in a major sprawling city, it would still be mathematically negligible over even very long lengths of pipe.\n\nWhile it's an awesome consideration to think about, I'm afraid it's just a tiny one.",

Each individual segment, generally speaking, needs to be oriented slightly down hill, at an angle such that it will flow via gravity at the necessary rate (on the scale of 1 ft/100 ft), and not allow puddles or bubbles to remain in the line. Given that, one does not generally need to design the system over distances that would require taking into account the curvature of the Earth. A line with a tolerance near the curvature of the Earth (8\" / mile) would be very expensive to achieve. If you design a system that requires that precision, you should go back to the drawing board.\n\nBridges are load bearing structures that require much more rigorous designs at higher precisions (smaller tolerances), so that the curvature may come into account. A normal highway designed over the same distance would not require that kind of precision.",
