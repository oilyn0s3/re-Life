            "body": "Two awesome questions!\n\nIt's pretty well established in the literature that mosquitoes use some form of auditory recognition in mate choice, and that is not at all uncommon across insects. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzWIuhXMUko) is an awesome video of male *Drosophila* vibrating their wings at a specific frequency to attract a mate. We've known for dozens of years that mosquitoes hear each others' buzz, but things started to get interesting in 2006.\n\n[This](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206016368) paper studied the mosquito *Toxorhynchites brevipalpis*, which exhibits low levels of dimorphism between the sexes. These guys had wing beat frequencies that were fairly similar to each other, and in mating their frequencies would converge.\n\nAfter this paper was published, everyone and their mother wanted to know what would happen with two species that have high levels of sexual dimorphism. Because males and females of most mosquitoes have vastly different sizes (males are smaller than the females-- those bugs everyone thinks are male mosquitoes aren't mosquitoes at all) they are incapable of converging on the same frequency. The Aegypti paper found that they instead modulate their frequency to their first shared harmonic, usually two harmonics up for the male and three for the female. [Several](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209006319) other [papers](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209020557) confirmed this across other species, including the *Culex* and *Anopheles* genus. Those two studies essentially tethered flying mosquitoes next to a microphone. Something startling to the researchers was that, across the board, the tone the mosquitoes were converging on was believed to be outside of their existing range of tonal perception. The authors of those papers speculated that the mosquitoes were eliminating \"dissimilar tones.\"\n\nWhat made the Aegypti paper so cool was that instead of sticking a microphone near the mosquitoes, it attached a small microphone/monitoring device right on to the mosquitoes Johnson's organ (or JO), which allowed them to hear it as the mosquito was hearing it, and study how the JO worked. They found that mosquitoes, in fact, could hear well past their proposed range of 1000 hz and all the way to 2000 hz.\n\nWhat might be REALLY crazy, is that they may only be able to do that while mating, and their hearing may return to normal after.\n\nAs for the other question... I have no idea! That's an awesome hypothesis, though. Given that the suite of similarly related *Anopheles* species probably use their wing beat frequencies to differentiate between species (who will all fly in the same mating swarm) I would say you are correct.\n\nSidenote: *Toxorhynchites* is probably my favorite mosquito. Over an inch long, some species are bright orange, and their larvae eat the larvae of other mosquitoes. As adults, Tox are vegetarians, living entirely off of plant nectar.",
