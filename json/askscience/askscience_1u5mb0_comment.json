When you raise the temperature even a little, it boils off before the water can be affected enough to freeze.",

This gas layer prevents water from contacting the dry ice directly and freezing.\n\nReference: \n\nAntonini, C., Bernagozzi, I., Jung, S., Poulikakos, D. &amp; Marengo, M. 2013.

Gasses are very slow to transfer thermal energy, so the water is largely cooled in a uniform manner. There is no chance for small pockets of water to rapidly cool and turn to ice. As such ALL of the water has drop to 0C. The CO2 will have to absorb enough heat from the water to do that. I am on my phone so I can't easily do it, but you can calculate if you have enough dry ice to freeze water if you know the mass and temperature of both.",
