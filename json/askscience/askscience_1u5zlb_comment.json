            "body": "That's a good question! The clinical observation that skin with vitiligo glows under UV light actually prompted scientists to study the chemistry of pigment formation in the skin, citation:\n\nSchallreuter, K.U., Wood, J.M., Ziegler, I., Lemke, K.R., Pittelkow M.R., Lindsey, N.J., and Gutlich, M. (1993). Defective tetrahydrobiopterin and catecholamine biosynthesis in the depigmentation disorder vitiligo. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1226: 181-192.\n\nIn vitiligo, depigmentation occurs because the pigment-producing cells are not able to produce pigment. Pigment production is sort of like an assembly line. Various enzymes make different chemical modifications to produce a pigment end-product. In vitiligo, there is a stop-up somewhere in the assembly line because there is a shortage of a molecule called tyrosine. The stop-up halts production of the pigment melanin. The problem that causes the enzyme to work improperly is also responsible for the response to UV light...\n\nIn vitiligo, an enzyme called **GTP-cyclohydrolase I** (remember this enzyme!) produces too much (6R)5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobiopterin (6-BH4), which accumulates.\n\n6-BH4 is a cofactor (like a wrench for the assembly line worker): it does not get turned into a part of the pigment, but it is necessary. Specifically, 6-BH4 is like an adjustable wrench that gets stuck in a particular position after each use, and other workers have to return it to working condition. During the fixing procedure, some wrenches spontaneously become gunked up and accumulate because they can't be de-gunked fast enough. 7-BH4 is like a gunked-up wrench. In this analogy, the worker just picks up wrench-like objects and sometimes picks up a good wrench (6-BH4) or a gunked-up one (7-BH4). If he picks up a gunked-up wrench, he has to put it down, BUT, the gunked-up wrench is really sticky and is hard to put down (competitive inhibition). Obviously, this slows down the worker's production rate. The worker represents the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which turns phenylalanine into tyrosine. \n\nThus, accumulating 7-BH4 leads to decreased production of tyrosine, which is needed by other enzymes in the assembly line that crank out melanin. The decreased melanin production leads to the depigmented spots in vitiligo. It also leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine, which increases the production rate of **GTP-cyclohydrolase I**. You may recall that this enzyme was responsible for the overproduction of 6-BH4, which leads to the increased production of the unwanted byproduct 7-BH4. More gunked-up wrenches floating around pretty much stops tyrosine production. There are also some more downstream effects like reducing the number of tyrosinase enzymes that are made (workers hired).\n\n6-BH4 and 7-BH4 belong to a class of molecules called *pterins,* which are fluorescent. 6-BH4 is a little fluorescent (some glow), while 7-BH4 is very fluorescent (lots of glow) when exposed to UV light. Doctors use UV light (a type called a Wood's Lamp) to assess the progression/diagnose vitiligo because the progressing form has more 7-BH4 than stable forms. \n\nEditing for clarity and grammar.\n\n**Tl;dr** People with vitiligo have fluorescent molecules in their skin, as shown in [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/cPL2Z7n) of the paper above.
