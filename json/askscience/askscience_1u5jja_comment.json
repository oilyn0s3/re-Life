Of course the answer like many questions is it depends...\n\nIn the case of a spring we should consider how far from equilibrium it is. If you have stretched it just a little bit then internally its not likely to do much. If you have stretched it non-linearly then internal movement of atoms and plastic deformation is likely occurring.\n\nSo I think that the answer is if the mass of the shirt is enough to stretch the fabric out. It wouldn't fit you anymore but it would get rid of the wrinkles. \n\nCompressing an object seems just the inverse and equally valid. So if I stand an iron rod up on its end it will never really flatten itself out due to just gravity. I can't think of anything very solid that would flatten itself with our gravity. Though the border between solid and liquid could be in play here. ",
