There are plenty of women around the world who give birth with little help compared to what we do in developed nations. But sometimes they die, or the infant dies, or both. Since we know why that happens and what to do about it, we try to prevent it. Since we never know beforehand who's going to have problems and who's not, we give everyone pretty much the same treatment, so then it seems like everyone is dependent.\n\nWe also help cows give birth for much the same reasons we help women. If you're a rancher, you could just let your cows give birth and let nature take its course, but then you would lose a certain number of cows and calves each season. Presumably then, there are other animals out there who have problems with the birthing process, but we don't know about it because we're not there when it happens.",
