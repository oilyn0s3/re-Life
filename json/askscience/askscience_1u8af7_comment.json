            "body": "&gt;This means, of the DNA sequences \"unique\" to humans, Neanderthals have been found, by current incomplete count, to have 99.9% of these sequences. \n\nThis is incorrect. The statement you quote is about sequencing [coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing#Coverage), not genome similarity. Coverage is simply how many times a given spot in the genome has been sequenced. The more times a spot has been sequenced, the more trustworthy your sequencing is; thus, coverage is a measure of genome quality. \n\nBy 'uniquely mappable' they mean regions of the human genome that are not repeated multiple times within the genome, as much of the human genome is composed of chunks that are very similar to each other. Since they are so similar, if you sequence one of those chunks, it's hard to tell exactly where it belongs in the genome, so they're ignoring those repetitive chunks for this measurement. \n\nThus, they are saying that they have sequenced 99.9% of the non-repetitive parts of the Neanderthal genome at least 10 times (Assuming that the vast majority of the non-repetitive parts of the Neanderthal genome are similar to the modern human genome). This tells us nothing about how similar those sequences are.\n\nAs to OP's question, I'm having difficulty finding a straight answer in the relevant papers, but it's important to note that any such estimate will be mostly limited to measurements of single nucleotide changes, as the technology used to sequence archaic genomes does not deal very well with large insertions, deletions, or copy number variations.",

This DNA is very precious because it's hard to come by well preserved samples and bone is notoriously difficult to extract DNA from. Nevertheless, they have a few baseline Neanderthals and through extensive testing of modern day populations by geography, they have found sequences that are repeated in Neanderthals and modern Homo Sapien of European decent (near where Neanderthal lived).\n\nPopulations like modern day Pacific Islander do not show the same sequence, meaning it's not Homo Sapien in origin.
