Think of it this way: You have the nucleus and a statistical distribution of negative charge in a cloud around that. At any given time, the electrons are somewhere and the nucleus is somewhere, and all these particles have finite radii and mass. So, since these particles are not directly touching each other, we can conclude that either something else fills the remaining space between the average radius of the atom and the nucleus, or nothing does (i.e., it's empty space.) Empirically, it turns out there's no other mass in there, so atoms are considered to be mostly empty space.",

Electrons (when ever I talk about electrons I am also talking about electron clouds) can ether absorb, reflect, or transmit photons (light). When an electron absorbs a photon, the photon (which is essentially a packet of energy) is converted to thermal energy and essentially the photon ceases to exist (it is now heat energy). An electron can only absorb a photon when the photon is at the perfect frequency/wavelength. If it is not the perfect wavelength the photon is either transmitted or reflected. Ether way when a photon hits an electron with an out of sink frequency the electron moves up an energy level and then quickly drops back down, remitting the photon. When a photon is transmitted it is transferred from atom to atom until it is released out the other side (glass). When a photon is reflected the photon essentially bounces off the electron. \nIf an object absorbs all wavelengths of light except for red than the object will be red, as red is remitted.\nCredit where credit is due, this [website](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/u12l2c.cfm) helped me out a ton with answering this question I would recommenced that you check it out!

            "body": "This is where my knowledge starts to get a bit fuzzy. I do know that photons don't \"hit\" photons in the classical sense. They do not have to touch each other to interact and exchange energy. More over electrons and photons can't hit each other because they are point particles, meaning they do not take up any space (no volume). Because of uncertainty we do not know exactly where the electron is at all times without direct observation, therefore the electron cloud is a reference to a range of possibilities of where the electron could be. [a graph showing the statistical distribution of certain shells](http://www.forgottenplanet.com/studyguide/chem210/page02pic01.jpg) Quantum physics is all about probability because there is always a certain level uncertainty. So when a photon enters a shell (an electron shell is infinite, but after a certain point the probability of an electron being in a certain place becomes negligibly small) there is a probability that it could interact with an electron. If the photon enters an area where there is a high probability of an electron there is a higher probability of interaction. If the photon enter an area where there is a low probability of an electron there is a lower probability of an interaction. PS If anyone finds any thing wrong with my explanation please critique it.",
