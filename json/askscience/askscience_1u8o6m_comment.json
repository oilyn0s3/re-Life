            "body": "Most diurnal (daytime-roaming) mammals have round pupils (this includes lions and tigers). Animals which hunt/fart around during both night *and* day tend to have vertical slits (domestic cats, alligators, and snakes fall into this category). From Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they can exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil. This would explain why slit pupils tend to be found in the eyes of animals with a crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle that need to protect their eyes during daylight. Constriction of a circular pupil (by a ring-shaped muscle) is less complete than closure of a slit pupil, which uses two additional muscles that laterally compress the pupil. For example, the cat's slit pupil can change the light intensity on the retina 135-fold compared to 10-fold in humans. However, this explanation does not account for circular pupils that can be closed to a very small size (e.g., 0.5 mm in the tarsier) and the rectangular pupils of many ungulates which do not close to a narrow slit in bright light. An alternative explanation is that a partially constricted circular pupil shades the peripheral zones of the lens which would lead to poorly focused images at relevant wavelengths. The vertical slit pupil allows for use of all wavelengths across the full diameter of the lens, even in bright light. It has also been suggested that in ambush predators such as some snakes, vertical slit pupils may aid in camouflage, breaking up the cirular outline of the eye.\n\n**TL;DR:** Vertical slits protect the eyes of sensitive-eyed nocturnal animals from daylight glare more effectively than round pupils / shade peripheral zones of vision which reduce the focus of images at relevant wavelengths. \n\nEdit: A fun note: goats and some other prey species that live in plain-like areas have horizontal, rectangular-esque pupils. These are thought to allow better detection and recognition of obstacles or predators as they move rapidly into the field of vision, especially on the horizontal plane. \n\nAlso, doing a simple wiki or google search would have answered this question for you.

I'm actually interested now in a physicists response regarding the way light behaves on the eye due to your response.  Thank you!",
