In the denominator is surface tension, which isn't really in your control aside from adding detergent, which drops the tension. So basically you want to maximize velocity, as /u/inthekeyofbeast stated. But you also need sufficient mass transport, so there's a tradeoff there. I'd agree that 50% seems like a good starting point.\n\nAn alternative to using the splash dynamics for cleaning would be to directly create high Reynolds number (turbulent) effects, which enhance mixing. Laboratories use high-frequency vibrating plates for cleaning things like this.\n\nCaveat, I haven't directly studied much about multi-phase flow or sloshing and I don't have a lot of intuition for it. Actually simulating or determining an analytical answer to your question would be pretty difficult.",

            "body": "This is an extraordinarily difficult problem. Before addressing it directly its necessary to determine what exactly the problem even is. \n\nVery roughly the optimal result is that for a given series of N shakes, possibly defined as sudden harmonic acceleration about some axis through the bottle the mixing affect over the surface of a portion of the bottle is maximized. The force and composition of the shakes is embedded in an envelope of optimal vigor that limits how much impetus is provided towards the shaking. 100 weak shakes are not better than 10 strong ones from the human perspective. There's a human quantity in the situation that defines a limit and range of shaking options.\n\nAt its basics that requires a lot of understanding about how mixing occurs, what initiates and resists mixing actions, how the warm water is accelerated to form mixing waves and the form and location of the polar water globules which interact to wash the fatty/soapy milk off of the inside surface of the bottle, to which its adhered in a variety of temporary compounds. \n\nIts an iterative process as well. We're not trying to find what water level does the most mixing but what water level, possibly changing over N shakes through the mixing process will result in a cleaner bottle after N shakes. There may be discards and reshakes in the process.\n\nJust as a guess I think you're best with about 1/10th of the bottle filled with the warmest water easily available that is not scalding, shake for a few seconds, discard the water then redo that twice. If it isn't clear after the 3rd set of shakes soak the bottle in water and redo it last. \n\nShaking and discarding is generally more effective for any type of mixing related cleansing because the dilutions compound, similar to the way interest compounds. That assumes that the first mixing was effective in dislodging most materials into solution and the following mixes are more dilution specific. There will always be some material adhering to the inside of the bottle simply from dampness- the discard and reshake dilutes that until there is negligible material. Multiple rinses with a fraction of the liquid solvent are more effective than one rinse with all the solvent. \n\nThe logic behind multiple dilution is straightforward. Assume there's 1/2 tsp, or 2.4 ml, remaining stuck to the glass after each rinse. If you have 240 ml to rinse with and do it once it will dilute that 2.4 mil to around 1/100th or .01 concentration after one rinse. If you rinse with 80 ml once it will dilute that to near 2.4/80= .03 concentration after the first rinse. The 80ml rinse is 3X worse than the 240 ml rinse after the 1st rinse. However the 2nd rinse of 80 ml will leave the concentration at .03^2 or .0009 or ten times better than 1 rinse of 240. The 3rd rinse of 80 ml leaves the concentration at .000027, which is 370 times better than 1 rinse of 240. In actuality the dilution and concentration equations aren't done exactly above. I'm neglecting the volume contribution of the sample and assuming that the material was dissolved uniformly in the shaking. The mistake is small for the volume contribution term but larger for the \"did everything dissolve\" assumption. The milk will preferentially stick to the bottle surface. It contains a mixture of surfactants and fats.\n\nBeyond the effect of dilution dislodging in subsequent shaking with clean water can be more effective and compensate for the trouble of discard and refilling with warm water because discarding the milky water will replace it with more polar clean water.\n\nThe problem is closely related to how splashes are composed. That's one of the more difficult areas of computational fluid dynamics. It can't be modeled through just Reynold's number or KE equations becuase the specific things we are interested in are not about the whole fluid but more about the actions of a small portion of the fluid. Its like we're looking to model the motion of 1000's of tiny whips created by the shaking. its the tips motion and acceleration we're interested in.",
