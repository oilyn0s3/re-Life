In basic physics, every force has an equal and opposite one.  We don't explode because our inner pressure pushing outward is just the same as it is on the outside.  Likewise, we aren't crushed by atmospheric pressure (which is pretty heavy, mind you).  \n\nThe inner pressure sources from their own bodily functions and products produced by metabolism and the fishes' physical structure.   For example:  our body keeps pressure in it much like a balloon keeps pressure in it, except in the balloon's case it's inner pressure exceeds the outside pressure and inflates.  Air rushes down to fill our lungs because the diaphragm makes a pressure differential.  \n\nIn deep sea fish, the pressure of the body is simply just a product of the fish using water and gasses.  Gasses are compressible, which is why their gas bladders tend to be much smaller and reduced, but they take a LOT in due to the compressed nature.  Thus, [this happens when they are pulled up](http://www.mesa.edu.au/deep_sea/images/swimbladder.jpg).  Gruesome.  \n\nLiquids are very, very incompressible.  So you can put a lot of pressure on them without any problems, really.  This is why deep sea fish skeletons, on the whole, are reduced.  Less solid structure to compress, more pressure can be put on the liquid structure of the fish.\n\n",
