What I'm really getting at is, assuming the observer has the ability to see all EM wave frequencies (like a wake from a boat forming from its motion through the water), and assuming you could be traveling in the metophoric boat, moving through space at the speed of light, how would the light appear?  One of the consequences of Maxwell's Equations is that the speed of light is constant, Einstein goes on to say that therefore Time and Space must distort, so what I'm trying to wrap my head around (which could be well our of my reach) is what properties of the propogating wave change as you speed up to its speed through space.",

If an electron was dropping to a lower energy state, the motion of the atom away from you means that the momentum of the photon towards you must be smaller than it would be as if you're at rest. You would measure the spectral lines differently from that distant atom, because the lengths and times for that atom are distorted from where they are when you're at relative rest. And the particle in front of you, consequently you'll disagree about lengths and times (that particle will seem shorter than usual), and thus the light reflected from it will seem blue shifted.\n\nEssentially, nothing is \"fixed.\" Lenghts, times, are all relative. How \"long\" something is, how long a process takes, are all relative for different observers. Frankly, in the case of doppler shifting, I find it easier to think in terms of energy and momentum than time and length, but that's a little more maths than just the simple space-time difference.",
