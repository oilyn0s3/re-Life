            "body": "Actually, it's not bile- it's urobilin- but you were right about the rest. Hemoglobin is broken down into heme, which becomes bilirubin, which is conjugated in the liver then transferred to the gut and turned into urobilinogen. Some urobilinogen gets reabsorbed into the bloodstream (after all, the intestines are built to absorb) and in the bloodstream is converted to urobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys and gives a yellow color to urine. Drink enough water and it becomes diluted enough to appear clear.\n\nThe urobilinogen that remains in your intestine is further processed into stercobilin afterwards which gives a brown pigment to stool.\n\nOther colors can appear in urine and they're mostly the result of consumption of pigments. Over the counter UTI treatments contain azo dyes that turn urine a bright reddish orange color. Methylene blue will turn urine blue- though I have to say when I see blue urine my first thought is that someone thought they were getting drug tested and scooped water out of the toilet. Overconsumption of certain vitamins or treatment with medications like propofol (an anesthetic) will turn urine green. \n\nAs far as pathological conditions, blood in the urine can turn it either red or a brownish red. In conditions with cause jaundice, bilirubin will get reabsorbed into the bloodstream in higher amounts and end up in the urine, turning it brown. The presence of particulate matter, mucus, or white blood cells will make urine cloudy and opaque.",
